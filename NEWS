D-Bus 1.4.6 (2010-02-17)
==

  • Remove unfinished changes intended to support GTest-based tests,
    which were mistakenly included in 1.4.4

D-Bus 1.4.4 (2010-02-17)
==

  • Switch back to using even micro versions for stable releases; 1.4.1
    should have been called 1.4.2, so skip that version number
  • Don't leave bad file descriptors being watched when spawning processes,
    which could result in a busy-loop (fd.o #32992, NB#200248; possibly
    also LP#656134, LP#680444, LP#713157)
  • Check for MSG_NOSIGNAL correctly
  • Fix failure to detect abstract socket support (fd.o #29895)
  • Make _dbus_system_logv actually exit with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_FATAL
    (fd.o #32262, NB#180486)
  • Improve some error code paths (fd.o #29981, fd.o #32264, fd.o #32262,
    fd.o #33128, fd.o #33277, fd.o #33126, NB#180486)
  • Avoid possible symlink attacks in /tmp during compilation (fd.o #32854)
  • Tidy up dead code (fd.o #25306, fd.o #33128, fd.o #34292, NB#180486)
  • Improve gcc malloc annotations (fd.o #32710)
  • If the system bus is launched via systemd, protect it from the OOM killer
  • Documentation improvements (fd.o #11190)
  • Avoid readdir_r, which is difficult to use correctly (fd.o #8284,
    fd.o #15922, LP#241619)
  • Cope with invalid files in session.d, system.d (fd.o #19186,
    Debian #230231)
  • Don't distribute generated files that embed our builddir (fd.o #30285,
    fd.o #34292)
  • Raise the system bus's fd limit to be sufficient for its configuration
    (fd.o #33474, LP#381063)
  • Fix syslog string processing
  • Ignore -Waddress
  • Remove broken gcov parsing code and --enable-gcov, and replace them
    with lcov HTML reports and --enable-compiler-coverage (fd.o #10887)
  • Windows:
    · avoid live-lock in Windows CE due to unfair condition variables
  • OpenBSD:
    · support credentials-passing (fd.o #32542)
  • Solaris:
    · opt-in to thread safety (fd.o #33464)

D-Bus 1.4.1 (20 December 2010)
==

 • Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can
   crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously
   only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic
   nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
   issue.
 • OS X portability fixes, including launchd support.
 • Windows autolaunch improvements.
 • Various bug fixes.

D-Bus 1.4.0 (6 Sep 2010)
==
 - systemd hookup

D-Bus 1.3.1 (23 June 2010)
==
 - New standardized PropertiesChanged signal in the properties interface
 - Various portability fixes, in particular to Windows platforms
 - Support forking bus services, for compatibility

D-Bus 1.3.0 (29 July 2009)
==
 - ability for dbus-send to send to any bus (--address)
 - file descriptor passing on Unix socket transports
 - use of GCC atomic intrinsics for better processor support
   (requires -march=i486 or above for x86 compilation)
 - thread-safe FD_CLOEXEC setting on recent Linux kernels (2.6.24-27 and up)
   and glibc (2.9 for pipe2 and 2.10 for accept4)
 - feature negotiation in the bus daemon
