D-Bus 1.5.2 (2011-06-01)
==

Notes for distributors:

  This version of D-Bus no longer uses -fPIE by default. Distributions wishing
  to harden the dbus-daemon and dbus-launch-helper can re-enable this if their
  toolchain supports it reliably, via something like:

    ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIE LDFLAGS="-pie -Wl,-z,relro"

  or by using distribution-specific wrappers such as Debian's hardening-wrapper.

Changes:

  • D-Bus Specification v0.17
    · Reserve the extra characters used in signatures by GVariant
      (fd.o #34529, Simon McVittie)
    · Define the ObjectManager interface (fd.o #34869, David Zeuthen)
  • Don't force -fPIE: distributions and libtool know better than we do whether
    it's desirable (fd.o #16621, fd.o #27215; Simon McVittie)
  • Allow --disable-gc-sections, in case your toolchain offers the
    -ffunction-sections, -fdata-sections and -Wl,--gc-sections options
    but they're broken, as seen on Solaris (fd.o #33466, Simon McVittie)
  • Install dbus-daemon and dbus-daemon-launch-helper in a more normal way
    (fd.o #14512; Simon McVittie, loosely based on a patch from Luca Barbato)
  • Ensure that maintainers upload documentation with the right permissions
    (fd.o #36130, Simon McVittie)
  • Don't force users of libdbus to be linked against -lpthread, -lrt
    (fd.o #32827, Simon McVittie)
  • Log system-bus activation information to syslog (fd.o #35705,
    Colin Walters)
  • Log messages dropped due to quotas to syslog (fd.o #35358,
    Simon McVittie)
  • Make the nonce-tcp transport work on Unix (fd.o #34569, Simon McVittie)
  • On Unix, if /var/lib/dbus/machine-id cannot be read, try /etc/machine-id
    (fd.o #35228, Lennart Poettering)
  • In the regression tests, don't report fds as "leaked" if they were open
    on startup (fd.o #35173, Simon McVittie)
  • Make dbus-monitor bail out if asked to monitor more than one bus,
    rather than silently using the last one (fd.o #26548, Will Thompson)
  • Clarify documentation (fd.o #35182, Simon McVittie)
  • Clean up minor dead code and some incorrect error handling
    (fd.o #33128, fd.o #29881; Simon McVittie)
  • Check that compiler options are supported before using them (fd.o #19681,
    Simon McVittie)
  • Windows:
    • Remove obsolete workaround for winioctl.h (fd.o #35083, Ralf Habacker)

    · Add support for path_namespace and arg0namespace in match rules
      (fd.o #24317, #34870; Will Thompson, David Zeuthen, Simon McVittie)
    · Make argNpath support object paths, not just object-path-like strings,
      and document it better (fd.o #31818, Will Thompson)
  • Let the bus daemon implement more than one interface (fd.o #33757,
    Simon McVittie)
  • Optimize _dbus_string_replace_len to reduce waste (fd.o #21261,
    Roberto Guido)
  • Require user intervention to compile with missing 64-bit support
    (fd.o #35114, Simon McVittie)
  • Add dbus_type_is_valid as public API (fd.o #20496, Simon McVittie)
  • Raise UnknownObject instead of UnknownMethod for calls to methods on
    paths that are not part of the object tree, and UnknownInterface for calls
    to unknown interfaces in the bus daemon (fd.o #34527, Lennart Poettering)

D-Bus 1.4.8 (2011-04-08)
==

The "It's like the beginning of a lobster" release.

  • Correctly give XDG_DATA_HOME priority over XDG_DATA_DIRS (fd.o #34496,

    booleans when sending them (fd.o #16338, NB#223152; Simon McVittie)
  • Add UnknownObject, UnknownInterface, UnknownProperty and PropertyReadOnly
    errors to dbus-shared.h (fd.o #34527, Lennart Poettering)
  • Break up a huge conditional in config-parser so gcov can produce coverage
    data (fd.o #10887, Simon McVittie)
  • List which parts of the Desktop Entry specification are applicable to
    .service files (fd.o #19159, Sven Herzberg)
  • Don't suppress service activation if two services have the same Exec=
    (fd.o #35750, Colin Walters)
  • Windows:
    · Avoid the name ELEMENT_TYPE due to namespace-pollution from winioctl.h
      (Andre Heinecke)
    · Include _dbus_path_is_absolute in libdbus on Windows, fixing compilation
      (fd.o #32805, Mark Brand)

==

  • Switch back to using even micro versions for stable releases; 1.4.1
    should have been called 1.4.2, so skip that version number
  • Don't leave bad file descriptors being watched when spawning processes,
    which could result in a busy-loop (fd.o #32992, NB#200248; possibly
    also LP#656134, LP#680444, LP#713157)
  • Check for MSG_NOSIGNAL correctly

  • Make _dbus_system_logv actually exit with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_FATAL
    (fd.o #32262, NB#180486)
  • Improve some error code paths (fd.o #29981, fd.o #32264, fd.o #32262,
    fd.o #33128, fd.o #33277, fd.o #33126, NB#180486)
  • Avoid possible symlink attacks in /tmp during compilation (fd.o #32854)
  • Tidy up dead code (fd.o #25306, fd.o #33128, fd.o #34292, NB#180486)
  • Improve gcc malloc annotations (fd.o #32710)
  • If the system bus is launched via systemd, protect it from the OOM killer
  • Documentation improvements (fd.o #11190)
  • Avoid readdir_r, which is difficult to use correctly (fd.o #8284,
    fd.o #15922, LP#241619)

    (fd.o #33474, LP#381063)
  • Fix syslog string processing
  • Ignore -Waddress
  • Remove broken gcov parsing code and --enable-gcov, and replace them
    with lcov HTML reports and --enable-compiler-coverage (fd.o #10887)
  • Windows:
    · avoid live-lock in Windows CE due to unfair condition variables
  • OpenBSD:
    · support credentials-passing (fd.o #32542)

D-Bus 1.4.1 (20 December 2010)
==

 • Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can
   crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously
   only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic
   nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
   issue.
 • OS X portability fixes, including launchd support.
 • Windows autolaunch improvements.
 • Various bug fixes.

==
 - New standardized PropertiesChanged signal in the properties interface

D-Bus 1.3.0 (29 July 2009)
==
 - ability for dbus-send to send to any bus (--address)

   (requires -march=i486 or above for x86 compilation)
 - thread-safe FD_CLOEXEC setting on recent Linux kernels (2.6.24-27 and up)
   and glibc (2.9 for pipe2 and 2.10 for accept4)
